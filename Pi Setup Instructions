**Create Executable File**
	With Processing sketch open, go to file>Export Application
	Select Raspberry Pi 64-bit, select Presentation mode.
	This will create a folder "linux-aarch64" in your sketch folder.
	Copy any images, fonts into this folder.
	Open the .sh file that shares the name of your sketch (might not
	have ".sh" in filename). 

**Hiding the mouse**
	install unclutter (sudo apt install unclutter)
	run "sudo raspi-config"
	go to "6 Advanced options>A6 Wayland> W1 X11" and press enter. Reboot.
	run "unclutter -idle 0.1" Number is the number of seconds before hiding mouse.
	Open the executable file in a text editor (from above, "EmotionFace_Serialin.sh"
		in this example.
	Below "#!/bin/sh" add "unclutter -idle 0.1 &" this will run unclutter before the
		program starts.


**Opening file**
	Make sure Processing is closed - Serial might get mad
	Double-click file from above... or...
	
	Command Line - navigate to directory, type ./filename(./EmotionFace for example)


	
**Auto Start Setup (learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-run-a-raspberry-pi-program-on-startup/all#method-2-autostart)
	Make "autostart" directory in "/home/pi/.config" 
	On this pi it would be home/scikiface/.config/autostart
	**.config is a hidden folder, just a heads up.

	Make a file in the autostart directory called name.desktop
	(emoface.desktop in our case)

	edit the file and put in the following:
		[Desktop Entry]
		Type=Application
		Name=EmotionFace
		Exec=/home/scikiface/Desktop/EmotionFace_SerialIn/linux-aarch64/EmotionFace_SerialIn
	Now it should autostart on reboot!
